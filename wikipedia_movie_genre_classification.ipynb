(nick kroll), or as he calls himself, professor p. captain underpants (disguised as mr. krupp) hires him to be the new science teacher, but george and harold are suspicious of him due to his violent and short-tempered attitude, as well as his resume  content. as it turns out, poopypants is seeking to get rid of laughter altogether due to the fact that people have made fun of his name for years. he recruits melvin to help him, as he discovers (after reading a comic book george and harold made featuring characters resembling them) that melvin  brain makes him incapable of laughing or having fun. after a school carnival accident caused by captain underpants, mr. krupp finally separates the boys. professor poopypants tries to take over the town with a giant version of the turbo toilet 2000, fueled by the school cafeteria  rotten leftovers left out by edith and uses melvin  brain to turn the children into glum, humorless zombies. captain underpants tries to stop the villain, but due to having no actual superpowers, is effortlessly defeated and thrown into the toilet. george and harold are captured and nearly turned into zombies, but are able to escape after professor poopypants mentions the planet uranus, causing the boys to laugh and damage the turbo toilet 2000  computer, restoring the children back to normal. upon consuming the mutated leftovers, captain underpants acquires superpowers and, with george and harold  help, defeats and shrinks poopypants, though he escapes on a bumblebee shortly thereafter. knowing that they can not  control captain underpants, george and harold destroy the hypno ring to permanently change him back into mr. krupp. feeling that mr. krupp would be nicer if he had friends, the boys set him and lovesick edith up on a date, thus making mr. krupp have a change of heart. krupp returns the comics he took away from george and harold, and even admits their comics are funny. however, the toxic waste from the turbo toilet 2000 transforms all the toilets into vicious monsters which attack the restaurant at which mr. krupp and edith are dining. upon snapping his fingers, mr. krupp once again becomes captain underpants, carrying george and harold away to help him fight them, much to edith  surprise and admiration. in a mid-credits scene, george and harold realize that the secretary, who they put on hold before by faking a contest with a cash prize of $1 billion, has been on the phone for the entire film, so they shut off the call, make the secretary angry, and make a new comic based on her reaction.\n",
